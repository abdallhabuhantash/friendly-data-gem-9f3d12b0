"""Immutable anonymous exam-subject identity contract (Phase 2, corrected).

An *exam session subject* is a stable anonymous handle (``S001``, ``S002``, …)
for **one logical physical person** inside **one exam session**. See
``docs/exam-session-identity-contract.md``.

The primary invariant of this module:

    Once ``S017`` has been assigned to a physical person, ``S017`` belongs to
    that person for the rest of the session. It is never renumbered, never
    transferred to somebody else, and never reused — not when the person walks
    to another desk, not when the raw tracker id changes, not when the person is
    lost entirely.

``S017`` is therefore **person-scoped**, never seat-scoped, location-scoped,
bounding-box-scoped or raw-tracker-scoped.

Two concepts are kept strictly separate:

```text
subject lifecycle     ACTIVE -> TEMPORARILY_LOST -> LOST -> ENDED   (existence)
track association     CONFIRMED / PROVISIONAL / UNRESOLVED / CONFLICT (binding)
```

A subject keeps existing (and keeps its number reserved) while its current
track association is ``UNRESOLVED``. Motion state is mobility-aware evidence for
short-gap recovery only: it moves with the person and is never a seat, a place
registration or an identity.

Everything here is pure data: no OpenCV, no Supabase, no clocks, no I/O.
