"""Keeps running capture workers in sync with the console configuration.

Stream incarnations
-------------------
The same camera UUID may represent several sequential *stream incarnations*:
camera A generation 1 reads source X, generation 2 reads source Y. Every time a
worker is created for a camera id, that camera's generation is incremented, so
consumers can detect an incarnation boundary explicitly instead of guessing from
frame sequence numbers or object identity.

`snapshot(camera_id)` returns worker + config + generation read together under
one lock, so an inference loop can never mix a new worker with a stale
generation. `lock(camera_id)` hands out one narrow per-camera lifecycle lock:
camera A's transition never blocks camera B's work.
